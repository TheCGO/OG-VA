# OG-VA

`OG-VA` is a package that provides code and data to calibrate an overlapping-generations (OG) model to the economy of the US state of Virginia (VA). `OG-VA` uses as a dependency the [`OG-Core`](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-Core/) package, which contains the core theory and logic of a general OG model. The `OG-VA` calibration package and the `OG-Core` theory and logic make the model that allows for dynamic general equilibrium analysis of federal and state fiscal policy in the state of Virginia. The model output focuses on changes in macroeconomic aggregates (state GDP, investment, consumption), wages, interest rates, labor, and the stream of tax revenues over time. This documentation of the `OG-VA` package contains the following major sections, which are regularly updated.
